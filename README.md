## Personal Statement

Iâ€™m a quantitative analyst and educator specialized in AI, with dual graduate degrees in Data Science (Computer Science Track) and Accountancy (Regulatory Compliance Track) and over a decade of experience in data modeling and process automation across global organizations. I have a proven track record of designing and building machine learning and deep learning solutions that enhance efficiency, support regulatory compliance, and generate scalable insights.

As a university lecturer, Iâ€™ve taught and facilitated courses in artificial intelligence and financial analytics, and I continue to pursue advanced graduate AI training at Stanford University.

A deeply curious and interdisciplinary thinker, Iâ€™m passionate about demystifying AI and advancing its practical applications across the financial industry. Outside of work, Iâ€™m an avid traveler and polyglot, and I proudly served in the U.S. Army Reserve.
